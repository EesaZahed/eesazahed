I'm Eesa Zahed. I'm 13 years old and I'm interested in technology, history, and math.

I started to learn the concepts and fundamentals of programming at a young age, and I'm currently a learner of Full-Stack development. I mostly code with MERN, Google Firebase, and REST APIs. I use HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, React, Firebase, MongoDB, Python, and Flask.

My favourite projects of mine:
